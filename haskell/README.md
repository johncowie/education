## Starting up the repl

``` ghci ```

## Basic Types

### Numbers are as you'd expect (infix)

### Strings

- Can be concatenated together with ``` ++ ```

e.g. 
```haskell 
"hello " ++ "world"
```

### Characters

Represented with single quotes e.g. ``` 'a' ```

A string is just a list of characters

i.e. ``` ['a', 'b'] = "ab" ```
